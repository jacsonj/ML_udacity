# ML_udacity
Machine Learning Nanodegree

Install
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

* NumPy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

Udacity recommends our students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.


# Projects

[Chicago Bikes](https://github.com/jacsonj/ML_udacity/blob/master/Chicago-Bike.ipynb)

In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also create some important functions and plot charts.

[Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/jacsonj/ML_udacity/blob/master/boston_housing_PT.ipynb)

In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.
